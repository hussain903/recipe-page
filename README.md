### What I learned
In the course of this challenge, I learned several several things such as using fonts stored in my directory, adding line spacing, styling the markers for list (ordered and unordered list) and how to remove the top and bottom border of a table. The challenge also made me realize that coding is a continous learning process, you have to keep reearching to learn new and innovative ways of tackling real life challenges.

### Continued development
I'd like to focus on building my skills in CSS in order to improve my creativity and develop a fast working habit.


### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) - This helped me easily find out codes which I may have forgotten or didn't know I could use in certain ways. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Learn CSS] - This is an amazing mobile app that serves as a reference article which helped me finally understand the basics of CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning.
